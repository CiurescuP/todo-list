# todo-list
A To-Do List made with HTML, CSS and Javascript!
Because I am at the beginning of the journey, I wanted to do a simple, but responsive and interactive To-Do List. With the right researches I could have made it more complex, like storing the data inside the to-do list so when you refresh the page, it is still there, but as a junior, I wanted to go easy. And so I did, and something I'm really proud of came out of it.
